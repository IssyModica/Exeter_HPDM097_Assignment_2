Simluation Model Notes

05/03/2025 - Issy

Notes regarding first simulation model
- look at how all the beds are never occupied therefore there is not queing for beds
- should we change how many patients first enter the model with still upholding each patient types IAT
- look at time in system (should match the mean time in the unit specified in model peramters)
- is time to ESD wrong/redundent as would be the same as time in the unit

Next model updates
- fix above issues 
- decided how to have all patient types enter the system at one time 
- include individual patinet group length of stays
